# Automated Code Generation and Unit Testing.

The purpose of this assessment is to give you an appreciation of automated code generation
technologies.

Project INFORMATION
You are to work in pairs and are required to use ChatGPT to generate code for the case study,
followed by unit testing and recommendations.

# Case Study
Learning Management System
Over a period of last 50 years, Flinders University has gained the trust and satisfaction of
a large student base in SA. To cope with the expectation and satisfaction of a large number
of Students, Flinders wants to introduce an effective Learning Management System (LMS).
Though it will be integrated into the Flinders website, every student and academic staff should
be authenticated while entering the LMS. Students will be able to access all their course material
through the LMS. An academic calendar will highlight all the assignment and exam schedules
for convenience and time management. Students will be able to upload assignments, take part
in online exams and check their grades through the LMS. Academics should be able to upload
contents and communicate with students through open student discussion forums. For privacy
protection, the LMS will request authentication after any inactivity of ten minutes after opening
the LMS page. A user will be able to logout at any time from the LMS page.
HINT: The problem described above mentions various actors and use cases to be
considered for the new system. If required, you are allowed to make assumptions
in order to outline the detailed working of your solution.

# Deliverables
You are required to submit a report consisting of three sections as follows:
1. List of Prompts used to generate the code (15%): Prompt engineering is a technique of
designing inputs for the tools like ChatGPT. The input could be a set of requirements
(instructions) that will produce the required code. The initial output (code) of ChatGPT
can be improved by providing more precise prompts (requirements) to ChatGTP.
For the final report you are required to do the following:
i. Document all the prompts that you used to generate the code
See Appendix 1 for an example of code generation using prompts.
2. Documentation of unit test cases (15%): Once the code generation is complete, you are
required to perform the unit testing of the code. You can export the code from ChatGPT,
save them as java files. Create a new project in IntelliJ IDE and copy the exported files to
the ’src’ folder of the newly created project.

For the final report you are required to do the following:
i. Upload your IntelliJ Project containing the generated code.
ii. Write at least 10 Test cases for the generated code.
iii. Document the outcome of each test case.
iv. Indicate the coverage of the test cases written.
3. Final Recommendations (10% - maximum 500 words): Finally, you need to provide your
recommendations on the quality of code generated and potential risk associated with automated
code generation technologies.
